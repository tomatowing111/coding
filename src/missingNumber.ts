/**
 * Problem: Missing Number
 *
 * Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range [0, n],
 * return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [3,0,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3].
 * The missing number is 2.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [0,1]
 * Output: 2
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
 * Output: 8
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - n == nums.length
 * - 1 <= n <= 10^4
 * - 0 <= nums[i] <= n
 * - All the numbers of nums are unique.
 *
 * Follow up:
 * Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity
 * and O(n) runtime complexity?
