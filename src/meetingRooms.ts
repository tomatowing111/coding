/**
 * Problem: Meeting Rooms (canAttendMeetings)
 *
 * Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times 
 * [[s1, e1], [s2, e2], ...] (si < ei), determine if a person could attend all meetings.
 *
 * Return true if a person can attend all meetings, or false if there is a conflict.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: A person cannot attend all three meetings since [0,30] overlaps with [5,10] and [15,20].
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: A person can attend both meetings since they do not overlap.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 0 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
 * - intervals[i].length == 2
 * - 0 <= start_i < end_i <= 10^6

// Intervals as [start, end). Returns true if no overlaps.
